The games development and code development has been haulted for the current moment.
As a development team we have more games that we should be working on such as one that should have been released over a year ago, and is still not stable for release. 
This game is stable enough for release and has been haluted on any other performance updates and such, Season updates may also be delayed as we are in such high demand.
Thank you for your understanding.

We will still respond to bug reports and suggestions from the community so that we have an idea on what to change when we get to it.
But for now, the game will not recieve updates for the most part and new seasons may be delayed up to 3 to 4 weeks. Please stay patient. 

-BexDevTeam.
